    <l>Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor.</l>
    <l>There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice</l>
    <l>Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.</l>
    <l>Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula</l>
    <l>Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse</l>
    <l>Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us,</l>
    <l>And bid her steal into the pleach√®d bower</l>
    <l>Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun</l>
    <l>Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites,</l>
    <l>Made proud by princes, that advance their pride</l>
    <l>Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her</l>
    <l>To listen our propose. This is thy office.</l>
    <l>Bear thee well in it, and leave us alone.</l>
